CST2120 – Web Applications and Databases
Coursework 1: Game Website (2025)

This repository contains my submission for CST2120 Coursework 1, an individual project worth 50% of the module grade. The task was to design and build a fully functional web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including user accounts, score storage, and a top-scores page using local storage (JSON).

## Project Requirements (Summary)

This coursework required the creation of a game website with the following features:

## Game Functionality

Playable game running entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Player can play solo or against the computer (random AI acceptable).

No use of PHP or backend databases (0 marks awarded if used).

All data stored in HTML Local Storage using JSON.

## User System

User registration and login system.

A Top Scores page showing the highest scores of all registered users.

Scores stored and retrieved from localStorage.

## Web Requirements

Fully client-side implementation.

Cross-browser support not required (one browser is fine).

Use of third-party libraries permitted (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap), as long as core logic is original.

## Submission Requirements

Included in the final zip:

All HTML, CSS, JS, and image files

PDF/Word report

5-minute video demonstration



## How to Run the Website

Download or clone the repository.

Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome recommended).

Register or log in through the login page.

Start the game and enjoy!

No server or backend is required — the entire website runs locally.

## Notes

This project was completed as part of CST2120 – Web Applications and Databases at Middlesex University, as a first-year assignment.
